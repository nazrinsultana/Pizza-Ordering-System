The Pizza‑Ordering‑System is a Java console application that guides a customer through a simple, menu‑driven workflow: placing new orders, viewing all existing orders, or deleting unwanted ones. When placing an order, the user enters their name, chooses either a Regular or Sicilian pizza, picks a size (12", 14", 16", or 18"), and adds toppings one by one until they’re done. The system then calculates and displays a detailed summary—including customer name, pizza type, size, toppings list, and total cost—and persists the record in a MySQL database using the DBHelper class. Viewing orders pulls all entries from the database for review, while deleting prompts for an order ID and removes that record. Under the hood, an abstract Pizza class defines shared behavior, with Regular and Sicilian subclasses overriding the topping logic, demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism, and seamless JDBC integration in a clear, user‑friendly console interface.
